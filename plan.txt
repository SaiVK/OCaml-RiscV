TEE support - compartmentalization support

Task 1: Add compatibility for .cap files

(TODO, Help required: to have a separate captable file for implementation, because of this "not able to find cmi file" included the captable code in compenv)

cap_hash.ml(i) in utils/
in Makefile, add utils/cap_hash.cmo line 86-87
		
		open Hashtbl (in emit.mlp)
	=>	let cap_id = Hashtbl.find cap_hash fundecl.fun_name
			emit.mlp line 558, after
		In emit.ml file this will be there(emit_string "checkcap"; emit_int cap_id; emit_string "\n");
	=>	`	checkcap {emit_int cap_id}\n`;
	
		
	in driver/compenv.ml, in main.ml you don't have access to the filename.
		

Task 2: Mirror exception semantics for shadow stack

Task 3: Tail call optimization	
	(riscv-spec.pdf pg 130)
	csrr rd, csr csrrs rd, csr, x0 Read CSR 
	csrw csr, rs csrrw x0, csr, rs Write CSR
	csrs csr, rs csrrs x0, csr, rs Set bits in CSR
	csrc csr, rs csrrc x0, csr, rs Clear bits in CSR

	Use any of the above to set tailcall_csr bit

	Why substitution only for free variables? Free vs bound vs binding? Isn't substitution on bound variables equal go renaming? Two abstraction terms in place of ( M N ), what does this mean?
	Beta Reduction not a substitution? Beta Reduct should be variable only or can be a lamda term like abstraction also? How to make Beta be symmetric?
	How did they define the succ function as nfx. f(nfx) and also for add & mult how did they define?
	How iszero function formed?
